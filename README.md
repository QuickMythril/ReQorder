# ReQorder
A Qortal Qompanion

With this application you can monitor and track your Qortal node, your minting account and any addresses that you wish to keep track of, as well as some important system resources like internet data usage, CPU temperature and the size of the Qortal blockchain on your device. Some key properties of the Qortal network, like the blockheight, number of minters online and QORT price relative to other crypto currencies can also be monitored.

This data will be stored in a database on your device, enabling you to keep a historical record of Qortal related data that you are interested in, which can be used for many purposes. 

These include, but are not limited to:

-tracking your minting efficiency and your QORT rewards

-estimating the levelling duration of your Qortal minting account based on your actual minting history

-keeping track of the growth of the Qortal network

-QORT balance alerts

-minting halted alerts

-node offline alerts

-node out of sync alerts


ReQorder is a lightweight, cross-platform and low footprint application, which means it can run parallel with your Qortal core on Windows, Mac or Linux systems without using much system resources (CPU, RAM, internet data, disk space). 

 Enjoy!
